## Introduction

The **LLaMa in Action** repository offers a structured approach to learning and implementing cutting-edge AI concepts. Each chapter or module includes code examples, exercises, and documentation to deepen your understanding and accelerate practical skill-building.

**Note:** The repository will be updated regularly. Please check back often for the latest improvements and new content.

## Environment Setup

To run the code examples smoothly, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:

- **Python Version**: 3.x
- **Dependencies**: Install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

We recommend using a virtual environment for better dependency management:

```bash
# Using venv
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`

# Using conda
conda create --name myenv python=3.x
conda activate myenv
```

## Code Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
├── chapter1/        # Code for Chapter 1
│   ├── example1.py  # Example code for the chapter
│   └── exercise1.py # Exercises for the chapter
├── chapter2/        # Code for Chapter 2
│   ├── ...
├── requirements.txt # Dependency file
└── README.md        # Repository documentation
```

## Usage

Each chapter folder contains code files reflecting the corresponding concepts. Run these files to explore and understand key topics.

Example:

```bash
# Navigate to Chapter 1 and run an example script
cd chapter1
python example1.py
```

## FAQ

1. **How can I get the latest updates?**  
   - Use `git pull` regularly to fetch the latest code and resources.

2. **What should I do if I encounter errors while running the code?**  
   - Ensure dependencies are installed and your environment is set up as per the documentation.  
   - If problems persist, check the README file for the specific chapter or open an issue.
